When OCHS Dhofar opened its doors in 1991 a tradition of committed                  service and dedication was established, focused on the health and well-being of                  those in our care. We know that to be fully a part of the nursing community means                   that we must play an active role in others’ health, far beyond the classroom walls.                  The Oman College of Health Sciences Dhofar, formally the Salalah Nurs-                   ing Institute, has transitioned into a four year college. We are seeing prog-                  ress  made  on  multiple  fronts,  higher  quality  students  enrolling  in  the  col-                  lege due to stiff competition, higher Omanization employment rates, and                   various construction projects underway to expand the size of the college.                  Many of our faculty and staff are OCHS Dhofar graduates, and as alumni, it is our                   priority to ensure that graduates and future graduates have opportunities to meet                  and exceed standards set forth by the Office of Director General education branch.

So in that time,            A A  he begins to make his decision to complete building himself           and his future, and this decision can be successful or failed.              And here we made a decision to take the name of the angels of mercy in           someday. On the path of nursing we become... at first we did not know            the meaning of the nursing. But as the days went by, we learned that           nursing was an honour for those who were lucky.              The nurse is the one who provides care for those who need it for 24           hours, who works with his heart, eyes, hands and all senses. Who is a            father, mother, brother, sister, son and daughter for each patient who           deals with him? Who feels pain, who faces difficulties, who is sincere           in giving, who makes the patient feel safe, who gives from his heart            always.              As we are nurses in the future, we should build ourselves well for this           profession, and this profession needs a high spirit, high ethics and           permanent tender. So, when you are a nurse, you must to be patient            enough. You have to be sincere. You should be very helpful to others,           and you should feel everything that the patient face it. When you bear           the name of a nurse, you have all the meanings of humanity.              Give your profession all the appreciation and present it with all love           and sincerity and remember that you are responsible for the lives            of many peoples. And maybe in one day, you will be a patient, so           everything you gave to others will come back to you. So you should do            whatever you want to get it back when you are in the place of others.","Advice to Future dvice to Future                             A                                 O                             OCHS StudentsCHS Students                                            Dear Future Students,,,                                    Here are some points for you to follow, and some advice from                                  my experience at OCHS. First, if you are a student at, you                                  must respect this great opportunity because you have a very                                 important role and responsibility in life. This is your time                                  and your future, so i know most of your thoughts might be                                  about teachers or classmates. Attitude towards learning is                                  important; it’s not the aptitude, but the attitude towards                                 the aptitude that achieves your goals. If we, as students                                  say to each other that a teacher isn’t helping us, why not                                  you try and tell the teacher what the issue is?  We can all                                 work hard at home and in the classroom to solve practice                                  exercises and then ask our teachers to correct them. Why                                  not study? Why not improve yourself? Take advantage of                                 this opportunity to improve your mind and improve yourself.

Bachelor of Science in Nursing 2019 – OCHS – Dhofar                Problem Statement:            Breast cancer is one of the most common cancers and a leading cause of death in women.          In Oman, the BC is more common and every year the incidences are increasing. Statistics in          Oman shows that BC in Omani women accounts for approximately 32% of the total cancer          cases and in 2015. The rate of BC in Oman is higher than other type of cancer, which was          about 24%. Al-Bahrani, B et.al(2015).The statistics of breast cancer in Dhofar region show          that there are 143 patients diagnosed with breast cancer (see : appendix B.7 ).There are many          risk factors associated with breast cancer such as: life style, obesity, processed diet and others.          Our study aimed to evaluate the knowledge level about breast cancer risk factors and preven-          tive measures for early detection and prevention of the disease among Foundation students at          Oman Collage of Health Science. Unfortunately, in Dhofar region the incidence of BC is in-          creasing because of lack of information related to the risk factors associated with breast cancer,          importance of early diagnosis and lack of skills to perform self-breast examination at home.            Methods \& Results:            The study is a quantitative quasi experimental study.  Questionnaire used as pre-test and post-test          with health education about BC risk factors and preventive measures as intervention to collect          quantitative written survey data from female foundation students in OCHS-DB (N=54) and (n          = 1280). The post-test was used to determine the effectiveness of health education. The study uti-          lized G** power Analysis with significance level confidence level 95%, 0.5 % confidence interval.            Results:            The independent t- test or paired- samples t-test was used to test the hypothesis and to          make the research meaningful and useful. The scores of knowledge were significant-          ly different for pre-test knowledge level (M = 22.30, SD = 4.604) and post-test knowl-          edge level (M = 34.70, SD = 2.582), t (Pair t- test) = -17.178, p =.000, therefore the          study reject the null hypothesis of zero difference and showed increased level of aware-          ness among female foundation students about BC risk factors and preventive measures.            Conclusion:            The null hypothesis is rejected; there is a significant difference between pre-test breast can-          cer knowledge and post-test breast cancer knowledge among female foundation students.","Quality Of Life of  Young Adults With End-Stage-Renal-Disease                                                      In Dhofar Region                                         Dr. Glenn Ford Valdez \& Mrs. Maryam Farhan       1                  Ahmed Rashid Bait Zaid, Jawaher Said Bait Bint Tawfiq, Khuloud Salmeen Bait Fadhilan, Layla               Said Al Mashikhi, Malhia Salim Al Mesheikhi, Maryam Mohammed Al Tamimi, Nidhal Khamis                              Al Khadhuri, Wegdan Suhail Al Awayad , Wrood Khalifa Al Ghafri       2                   1.

Several studies have been conducted to investigate and explore the prevalence,          epidemiology, and the causes of this disease as it effects and its patients in various level.          The  most  effected  aspect  is  the  quality  of  life  (QOL)  of  the  End  Stage  Renal  Disease  pa-          tient. The study aimed at identifying the demographic profile of the participants, explo-          ration  of the QOL  of young  adults  with  ESRD in  Dhofar,  examination  and  identification          of the association between the demographic profile and QOL of young adults with ESRD.            Methods \& Results            The study is a quantitative exploratory research.  This type of research is intend to explore the re-          search questions and doesn’t intend to offer final and conclusive solutions to the existing problems.          The study Hypothesis aims to prove HO : There is no association between the demographic profile,          developmental roles, HPM activities \& the QOL of young adults with ESRD, If the hypothesis Ho          will be rejected if p-value ≤ 0.05 as a decision criteria. In this Study, a purposive nonrandomized          sampling was used. Then, a G-power analysis with confidence level of 95% and confidence interval          of 0.05 used as an estimate post-HOC parameter, A sample size (n=30) based on qualified enroll-          ment criteria. The study population is inclusive of young adults aged between 18 to 39 years who had          ESRD and resided in Dhofar governorate was enrolled in the study. Prior to actual data gathering the          researchers secured an IRB from the local research committee.  A validated tool for survey was used;          the tool was given to the sample from young adults with ESRD in SQH through their ward in charge.          Frequencies and descriptive statistics are used to identify and evaluated essential competencies.            Results:            Our result showed that there is a weak positive and significant relationship (r= .036)  be-          tween the age of the participants  and the physical domain and the correlation between  lev-          el of education ,Monthly salary \&  QOL domains is a positive correlation coefficient .150 \&          .049  which mean there is weak relationship (r= .376)  \& (r= .893).adjectival rating that is good.

Bachelor of Science in Nursing 2019–OCHS –Dhofar              Problem Statement:           Myopia,  or  nearsightedness,  is  a  common  eye  condition  that  results  in  blurred vision  when         focusing  on  distant  objects,  but  clear  vision  when  viewing  near  objects  as  stated  by  Smith          and Walline  (2015). Many  researches  proven  that  myopia  is  not  as  any  simple  disease,  but         it  is  a major health issue in worldwide. It is the most common refractive errors in the world         varying by country  and  ethnicity,  reaching  as  high  as  70–90%  in  certain  Asian  populations         (Holden  BA, Fricke  TR,  et  al.  2016).  The aim of the current study is to determine the preva-         lence of myopia and the related risk factors  that causing it among nursing students of OCHS.           Methods \& Results           Population: target population was undergraduate  nursing  students  in  Oman  College  of         Health Sciences (OCHS) – Dhofar including (151) students. Consecutive sampling was the         sampling strategy that  was  accredited  in  conducting  the  study,  in  which  every  subject         meets  the  criteria  of  inclusion  is  selected  until  the  required  sample  size  is  achieved.  A         total  of  151  students participated  in  vision  assessment  and  answering  the  questionnaire.           Results:           The result of the research shows that 29.6 % of undergraduate nursing students in OCHS- Dhofar         suffering from Myopia (respondent rate was 76.1 %), 20 % affected in right eye, 8.6 % affected in left         eye and 71.4 % affected in both eyes. It is important to realize that, 40 % of the myopic participants         diagnosed with myopia before more than 3 years, 25.7 % diagnosed before 2-3 years and 31.4 %          diagnosed before 1-2 years.  In fact, 25.9 % of myopic participants used eye glasses as  a  correc-         tion  mode,  while  14.7 %  use  contact  lenses  and  32.4  %  did not  use  any  mode  of  correction.          Conclusion           The  findings  of  this  study  indicate  29.6%  prevalence  of  Myopia  among  un-         dergraduate    nursing  students    in    OCHS-  Dhofar.    Moreover,    the    common          risk    factors    among    undergraduate    nursing  students    in    OCHS-  Dhofar    are    ge-         netics,    using    electronic    devices    (phone,    computer,    watching  TV),  bad  nutri-         tion, long hours of concentration on studying and reading and the light condition.","A Study on Adherence to Therapeutic Regimen in, Disease Control and                 the related Factors Among Type 2 Diabetes Omani Patients in Dhofar.

In the last decade the cases of people living with diabetes          jumped almost 50% worldwide. It Type 2 DM affects more than 422 million people worldwide and there          will be an estimated 35000 people with type 2 DM living in Oman by 2050. Living with type 2 DM places an          enormous physical, emotional and financial burden on the family. Diabetes and its complications remain          major causes of morbidity and mortality, as it is a progressive disease, compliance to the treatment is essential          to maintain glycemic control and prevention of complication, thereby increase level of disease controlling,          but poor adherence to medications is known to be common in Type 2DM patients with adherence rate          varying from 30 -90%. It significantly undermines the effectiveness of treatment and represent an import-          ant issue in disease control. (Sabate E, 2003). The aim of this study was to describe adherence to therapeutic          regimen in, disease control and the related factors Among Type 2 diabetes Omani patients in Dhofar. H1:          There is a statistically significant prediction of level of adherence to therapeutic regimen by demographic          factors and disease profile of the typ2 diabetic Omani patients. H2: There is a statistically significant pre-          diction of disease control by demographic factors and disease profile of the typ2 diabetic Omani patients.           Methods \& Results            Population: The population of present study comprised of Omani patient with Type 2 Diabetic Mellitus.

Employees  may            be adversely affected by stress because it can cause fatigue and extreme nerv-            ousness. They may also hinder their production if they suffer from stress while            they are at work. Employees also feel less comfortable because of stress as it            affects  different  forms  such  as  difficulty  concentrating  and  irritability.  In  con-            trast, some employees are not affected by stress. Some employees say they            do not suffer from stress but feel a little. They don’t feel because they often or-             ganize their time and work that help them to avoid stress and prevent it.                    Recommendationecommendation               R              Nervous pressure can have a positive side at work because it can help you or-            ganize your time and also get your tasks done on time. The researcher recom-            mends that daily neurological stresses or short-term anxiety can actually benefit            the human brain and body.  Another type may be increased flexibility because it            makes you learn how to deal with stressful situations and can make dealing and            controlling future situations easier. For employees, the researcher recommends            that they should try to control the things around them that cause them stress,            especially if they feel that it really also takes a lot of their time, rather than do-            ing less important things. It is also recommended by other researchers to con-             duct further studies on the subject and investigate deeply the effect of stress.","NEEDS OF CANCER PATIENTS                              NEEDS OF CANCER PATIENTS               AT SULTAN QABOOS HOSPITAL IN SALALAH               AT SULTAN QABOOS HOSPITAL IN SALALAH                               AMIRA AL-MASHIKHI | MS.

The objectives of the research were to identify the needs of people with spe-            cial needs and the treatment of the community that helps them, determine            the service they should perform from the community and make some recom-            mendations to them by giving them the freedom to live. A questionnaire was            drafted and distributed to 20 randomly selected students, then the data were            analyzed. The results showed that all respondents were aware of the needs            of people with special needs and that about 40% of them knew children with            disabilities, and it was recommended that teachers and other authorities in            the Academy try to help people with disabilities and give them a normal life.

The term for people with special needs is rejected for a number of reasons;  one            is that it includes many groups, not just people with disabilities. To be more            specific, the term is a legal term that applies in the United States Children’s            Home, a derivative of the terms in the Adoption and Safe Families Act of 1997.            Some social associations are working in cooperation with the Ministry of So-            cial Development and the Ministry of Education, represented by the Depart-            ment of Special Education to provide schools and programs for this category.
